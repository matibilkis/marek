        How it works:

        What matrix B represents is that up to layer k, you consider the same displacements, and then varies
        from the different outcomes you might obtain departing from layer k. Then k varies, and you end up
        with all the tree of possible displacements. It's assumed that the same bunch of displacements is performed when
         you obtain the same sub-sequence of outcomesself.

        Note that the last number s1[-1], s2[-1] is not important for the displacements, as you not
        measure after that outcome: for example, if you obtain:

        s1 = {0,1}
        s2 = {0,0}

        But IT IS important if you obtain

        s1 = {1,0}
        s2 = {0,0}
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Example with 3 displacements & 3 photodetectors:

        We encode all possible displacements in a matrix B which will be of the form

        [bin  bin  bin  bin]
        [b0   b1   b0   b1]
        [b00  b01  b10  b11]

        It's important that the input is  params[0] = [bin, bin-0, bin-0, ...]

        The idea with this notation is as follows. At first displacement, you make displacement "bin", independent
        of the outcomes you can get, or the oucomes you go (which are none). At second displacement, you will
        make a displacement b0 or b1, depending on the oucome of the first photodetector. Still, you would have
        performed bin in the first layer (first displacement), so we take into account all possible displacements, which
        will be 2**(L-1) sequence of L displaecements.

        In this sense, we need to input all possible displacements, which are (2**(L) -1) where L is the number of photodetections
        and we substract 1 because we discplace first and then measure for the first time.


        So matrix B is a matrix of 2**L columns, and L rows.

        params[1] should have L numbers, which are the thetas, between 0 and Pi/2.
