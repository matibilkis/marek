# Marek: the RL agent that achieves optimal discrimination rates from scratch

This is the code that led to the results presented in "Real-time calibration of coherent-state receivers: learning by trial and error".
Marek's objective is to learn the optimal discrimination strategy over an unknown quantum-classical channel; we frame this as a reinforcement learning problem.

For instance, this kind of learning curves are obtained:
